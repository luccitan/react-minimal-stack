# React Minimal Stack ‚å®

This is a _personal_ stack to quickly start a React project.

It basically consists of React (üëç) and Webpack,
but the [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
has been added for a faster and more comfortable developement.

This stack has highly been influenced by
[Calesce's example](https://github.com/calesce/react-hot-loader-examples).
My stack may diverge in the future, that's why a personal repository has been made.

#### Quick starting

```
git clone https://github.com/luccitan/react-minimal-stack projectname

cd projectname && npm install && npm start dev
```

#### Architecture information

- Webpack output in `dist/`
- Static files (CSS, images, ...) in `static/`
- Project sources in `src/`
- React components in `src/components/`
